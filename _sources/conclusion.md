# Conclusions

### Consistent Choice, Consistent Rewards
In our data analysis using the k-means algorithm we looked at how does profit / loss margins correlate with a subjects consistency of choice and how regularly they pick their favoured deck. From our K-means analysis we learned that a consistency of higher choice led to greater financial rewards at the end of the trials. Although there was some outliers to the left of our scatter plot that picked their favourite deck a high number of times, we could see from our margin vs average choice plot that these subjects most likely picked lower numbers a large percentage of the time.

### Different strategies from males and females
It was also interesting to note from our scatter plot that there appeared to be a pronounced difference in how males and females selected their decks. Studies that indicated the number of female particpiants in their work (and that had high female representation) appeared to mix up their choices regularly over the course of the trials even after an initial period of observation. Whereas studies that did not indicate the number of female particpiants or had lower numbers appeared to be more consistent with their choices, experimenting initially and then sticking to decks they feel are winners.
